# How to Host Nodejs Apps on Namecheap

To host Nodejs apps on Cpanel like Namecheap can be intuitive and tedious sometimes especially if you are a beginner into the nitty-gritty of these technologies and platforms.

In this little article here, Iâ€™ll be showing you how to host your Nodejs apps on Cpanel like Namecheap.

### What is Namecheap?

Namecheap is an ICANN-accredited domain name registrar, which provides domain name registration and web hosting.

Getting Started

##### Step 1: Write some code!

We will create a simple Express application and host it on Namecheap in this tutorial.

##### Write some code!

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello world');
});

app.get('/:name', (req, res) => {
  const name = req.params.name;
  res.send(`Hello ${name}`);
});

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server is running on PORT ${PORT}`));
```

Save the code above in a file named `app.js`.

Whenever you make changes to the web application, you have to restart the application to effect the changes.

To do this, scroll up on the Node.js App page and locate the RESTART button, then click it.

Congratulations! You have successfully hosted a Node.js/Express application on Namecheap cPanel.

It is accessible via the domain you linked to the app during its creation.
